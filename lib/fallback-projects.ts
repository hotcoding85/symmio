Symmio launched the first DAO Framework in 2017 which secures over $40 billion in TVL. Symmio's tech stack allows anyone to launch a DAO, enabling organizations to securely govern their protocols and assets onchain.",
    integrationDetails: "Symmio is integrated with IndexMaker on multiple levels. First, Metaindexmaker vault curators can easily spin up trustless guardians for their vaults using the Symmio App. For example, Steakhouse Financial secures vaults for their depositors with Symmio Guardian DAOs. Second, any DAO or multisig on Symmio can now seamlessly use IndexMaker using Symmio's DappConnect, which enables onchain organizations to create actions directly through a Dapps user interface - no code required."
